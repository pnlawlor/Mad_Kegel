Mad_Kegel
=========
Repository for all things Kegel. We should try to modularize things as much as possible. 

LET'S DO THIS

fit_GLM.py:
mostly includes fitting methods although not limited to GLMs. for all of these, the inputs to the functions are just the X matrix, the y vector, and occasionally other parameters

could maybe use another file or another few files for feature generation and processing
